## Synopsis

In order to keep feedback forms _truly_ accurate, you must promise the
respondents anonymity. Cloak helps form administrators obtain **better feedback**
by using AI to rewrite respondents' submissions in a consistent style.
Eliminating any language bias that may expose respondents' identities, while
keeping original intent.

This makes every feedback obtained through forms _more valuable_.

Cloak features a full-fledged forms creator, with administrator account (and
hence, their forms) management.
